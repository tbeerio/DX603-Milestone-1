    "The Random Forest model performed the best overall, with the lowest average RMSE, meaning it made the most accurate predictions. It was also the most consistent, with the smallest variation in scores across different cross-validation folds. Gradient Boosting also performed well, coming in second in both accuracy and stability. In contrast, the Decision Tree had the highest RMSE and more variation, which could mean it's overfitting. The Linear, Ridge, and Lasso regression models all had similar and very stable results, but their higher RMSE scores suggest they may be underfitting."
