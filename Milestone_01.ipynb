While one could assume that missing entries imply the opposite (i.e., False or N), this would introduce an assumption that may not be valid. Additionally, imputing them would result in highly unbalanced features with limited predictive power. For these reasons, they are better dropped from the dataset. The remaining categorical features, `propertyzoningdesc` and `propertycountylandusecode`, contain zoning and land use information, but their interpretation and encoding would require domain knowledge. Given this complexity, these features will also be dropped from further analysis.\n"

    "Several features are being dropped due to limited business usefulness or redundancy. Both `calculatedbathnbr` and `fullbathcnt` overlap with bathroomcnt, which already captures total bathroom information more consistently. The unitcnt column, which indicates the number of housing units on a property, is often missing and adds little value for single-family homes, which dominate this dataset. We are also dropping `taxvaluedollarcnt`, `structuretaxvaluedollarcnt`, and `landtaxvaluedollarcnt` to avoid data leakage, as these are either the target or direct components of it. Lastly, `airconditioningtypeid`, `heatingorsystemtypeid`, and `buildingqualitytypeid` have high missingness and use internal codes that are difficult to interpret without reliable mappings. Given these issues, they are unlikely to add meaningful predictive value and will be removed."

    "|--------|---------|--------------|------|------|\n",
    "| **Drop Missing Values** | Few missing values (<5% of data) | `df.dropna()` | Quick and easy | Can remove valuable data |\n",
    "| **Mean Imputation** | Normally distributed numerical data | `df.fillna(df.mean())` | Preserves mean; simple | Distorts variance, weak for skewed data |\n",
    "| **Median Imputation** | Skewed numerical data | `df.fillna(df.median())` | Robust to outliers | May not capture patterns |\n",
    "| **Mode Imputation** | Categorical features | `df.fillna(df.mode().iloc[0])` | Keeps most common category | Can introduce bias |\n",
    "| **Constant Value (e.g., 0)** | Special cases (e.g., unknown numerical data) | `df.fillna(0)` | Simple and interpretable | Can mislead model |\n",
    "| **\"Unknown\" Category Imputation** (**New Addition**) | Categorical features with missing values | `df.fillna('Unknown')` | Keeps all rows, prevents data loss | May introduce artificial category |\n",

    "| **K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)** | Small datasets, patterns in features | `KNNImputer(n_neighbors=5).fit_transform(df)` | Uses similar observations | Computationally expensive |\n",
    "| **Multivariate Imputation (MICE)** | Complex relationships between variables | `IterativeImputer().fit_transform(df)` | Captures relationships | Slower than mean/median |\n",

    "- Customer data (e.g., missing survey responses → \"No Response\").  \n",
    "- Product categories where missing could be a separate group.  \n",
